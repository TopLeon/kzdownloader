## Overview

KZDownloader is a cross-platform desktop application built with Flutter that lets you download videos, music, and generic files from hundreds of websites. It integrates a powerful AI assistant that can summarize YouTube video content and answer questions about it. 

The design is modern, minimal, and fully reactive, featuring animated neon gradient borders on download cards and interactive elements, smooth transitions, and real-time progress feedback.

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Video & Audio Downloads
- Download videos and audio from **YouTube** and hundreds of other platforms powered by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
- Choose **video format** (MP4, MKV) and **quality** before downloading
- Download entire **YouTube playlists** with configurable concurrency — each video is tracked individually.
- Audio-only extraction to **MP3, M4A and OGG**.

### 📁 Generic File Downloader
- Blazing fast, multi-threaded, **IDM-style chunked download** for any direct HTTP/HTTPS link.
  - **Writer Isolate**: a dedicated Dart isolate writes data directly to the final file position via `RandomAccessFile`, eliminating temporary files and redundant I/O passes.
  - **Backpressure control (ackIterator)**: each network worker waits for the Writer Isolate to acknowledge a successful disk write before fetching the next chunk — preventing Out-of-Memory crashes when network throughput exceeds disk write speed.
  - **Dynamic Connection Reuse**: once a connection finishes its assigned byte range it is immediately reassigned to the slowest active chunk, keeping the maximum number of connections busy at all times for sustained peak download speeds.
- Automatic **resume support** — interrupted downloads pick up where they left off if the server supports range requests.
- Per-chunk progress visualization with active worker count and individual segment progress bars.
- Built on a Rust-based HTTP backend ([rhttp_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/rhttp_plus)) for maximum throughput and **TLS fingerprinting** to avoid bot-detection on protected servers.

### 🤖 Video Summaries & Chat
- Automatically fetch the **transcript** (or description) of a YouTube video and generate a structured summary using an LLM.
- Ask **follow-up questions** in a persistent chat session tied to the video — Q&A history is saved locally.
- **100% Local AI Capabilities**: Perform complete video analysis and chat offline with absolute privacy.
- Support for multiple AI providers:
  - **Ollama** (fully local, no data leaves the machine)
  - **LM Studio** (fully local, OpenAI-compatible local server)
  - **OpenAI** (need API key)
  - **Google Gemini** (need API key)
- Streaming text output with animated Markdown rendering.
- Configurable context size (max characters fed to the LLM).

### 🎵 Music Library & Player
- Dedicated **Music** tab listing all downloaded audio files.
- Built-in **audio player** with a progress bar, play/pause, skip, and seek controls.
- **Playlist management**: create named playlists and add tracks to them.

### 🔒 Security & Integrity
- **Checksum verification** (MD5, SHA-256) before triggering a download, ensuring file integrity.
- API keys stored in **secure storage** (OS keychain / credential manager).

### ⚙️ Settings & Customisation
- **Download directory** selection with onboarding prompt on first launch.
- Default **format**, **quality**, and **audio format** presets.
- **Dark / Light / System** theme with smooth transitions.
- **Interface language**: English and Italian.
- Configurable **concurrent downloads** per-playlist and globally.
- AI model and provider selection with API key management.

### 🖥️ Desktop Experience
- Interface split into dedicated sections: **Videos**, **Music**, and **Generic files** — each with its own layout, sorting, and search.
- Modern, minimal, and fully reactive design with real-time progress updates.
- Animated **neon gradient borders** (`RainbowAnimatedBorder`) around download cards and interactive elements, rendered via a custom `CustomPainter`.
- Glassmorphism glow blobs on the home screen and smooth CSS-style transitions throughout.
- Responsive layout with separate view adaptations for Windows/Linux and macOS.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| UI Framework | Flutter 3.x + Material 3 |
| State Management | flutter_riverpod + riverpod_annotation (code generation) |
| Local Database | isar_community |
| AI / LLM | langchain, langchain_ollama, langchain_openai, langchain_google |
| HTTP Client | rhttp_plus (Rust-based FFI, TLS fingerprinting) |
| Video Metadata | youtube_explode_dart + yt-dlp fallback |
| Audio Playback | just_audio + media_kit (Windows) |
| Secure Storage | flutter_secure_storage |
| Fonts & Icons | Google Fonts, ultimate_flutter_icons, not_static_icons |
| Localisation | Flutter Gen-l10n (ARB files) |

## 📦 External Binaries (auto-downloaded on first launch)

KZDownloader automatically downloads and manages the following external tools into the app's support directory — no manual installation required:

| Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **yt-dlp** | Video/audio download and metadata extraction |
| **ffmpeg** | Post-processing, remuxing, and audio extraction |
| **deno** | Needed by ytdlp for extracting data |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⬇️ Download

Pre-compiled binaries for Windows and macOS are available directly in the [**Releases**](../../releases) section — no build environment needed.

> ⚠️ macOS Users: Since the app is currently self-signed, Gatekeeper will block it on first launch. To run it, Right-click the app, select Open, and then click Open again in the dialog box.

### Build Process

#### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) ≥ 3.2.0
- Dart SDK ≥ 3.2.0
- A desktop target configured (`flutter config --enable-windows-desktop` / `--enable-macos-desktop` / `--enable-linux-desktop`)

#### Linux Only

If you are compiling this Flutter application on Linux (Ubuntu), you need to configure your environment correctly to avoid build failures with native plugins (such as `rhttp_plus` and `flutter_secure_storage`).

##### 1. Avoid Flutter via Snap
The Snap installation of Flutter runs in an isolated container and causes `glibc` library mismatches when compiling native Rust/C++ dependencies. 
If you installed Flutter via Snap, remove it and use the standalone repository clone instead:
```bash
sudo snap remove flutter
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable ~/.flutter
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.flutter/bin"

```

##### 2. Install Required System Dependencies

The project relies on native compilation tools, window manager libraries, Rust, and the GNOME Secret Service API. Install them using `apt` and `rustup`:

```bash
# Build tools, GTK development files, and Secret Service headers
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev libstdc++-12-dev libsecret-1-dev

# Install Rust toolchain (required for rhttp_plus)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Install libmpv for media_kit
sudo apt install libmpv-dev mpv

```

#### Clone & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TopLeon/KZDownloader.git
cd KZDownloader

# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run code generation (Isar + Riverpod)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Launch on your platform
flutter run -d windows   # or macos / linux
```

### First Launch

On the first run KZDownloader will:
1. Ask you to select a **default download directory**.
2. Automatically download **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg** in the background.

For AI features, open **Settings** and choose an AI provider:
- **Ollama**: install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) locally and pull a model (e.g. `ollama pull llama3`).
- **OpenAI / Google**: enter your API key in the Settings panel or on first launch — it is stored securely in the OS keychain.
